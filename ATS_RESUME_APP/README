Step 1: Install Required Libraries
You’ll need to install some Python libraries if you haven’t already:

pip install nltk pdfminer.six

Step 2: Download NLTK Data
You need to download some data for nltk:

Extracting Text from Resume: The code uses pdfminer.six to extract text from a PDF resume.
Tokenization and Cleaning: Text is cleaned and tokenized using NLTK. Stopwords are removed to focus on meaningful words.
Skill Extraction: This is a basic implementation where specific skills are hardcoded and matched against the resume content.
Resume Scanning: The resume is scanned against a job description, and matching words are identified.
