How does the Union's consumption of certain commodities and products contribute to global deforestation?,"According to the provided context, the Union's consumption of certain commodities and products contributes to global deforestation in several ways. Firstly, the Union imported and consumed one third of the globally traded agricultural products associated with deforestation between 1990 and 2008, accounting for 10% of worldwide deforestation associated with the production of goods or services. Secondly, Union consumption is a considerable driver of deforestation and forest degradation on a global scale, and without appropriate regulatory intervention, the Union’s consumption and production of six commodities alone (cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, soya, and wood) are estimated to rise to approximately 248,000 hectares of deforestation annually by 2030. Lastly, agricultural expansion drives almost 90% of global deforestation, with more than half of forest loss being due to conversion of forest into cropland, and livestock grazing is responsible for almost 40% of forest loss. Production of feed for livestock can also contribute to deforestation and forest degradation. Specifically, a recent research paper indicates that seven commodities represent the largest share of Union-driven deforestation: oil palm (34.0%), soya (32.8%), wood (8.6%), cocoa (7.5%), coffee (7.0%), cattle (5.0%), and rubber (3.4%). To ensure the effectiveness of the regulation, it is important to ensure that feed used for livestock falling within the scope of this Regulation does not lead to deforestation.","['(8) Union consumption  is a considerable  driver  of deforestation and  forest degradation on  a global scale.  The impact  \nassessment of this Regulation estimated that without appropriate regulatory intervention, the Union’s \nconsumption  and production  of six commodities  (cattle,  cocoa,  coffee,  oil palm,  soya  and wood)  alone  would \nrise to approximately  248  000  hectares  of deforestation  annually  by 2030.'
 'EN 9.6.2023  Official  Journal  of the European  Union  L 150/ 209  \n \n(18) The Union imported and consumed one third of the globally traded agricultural products associated with \ndeforestation between 1990 and 2008. Over that period, Union consumption was responsible for 10  % of \nworldwide deforestation associated with the production of goods or the provision of services. Even if the \nrelative  share  of Union  consumption  is decreasing,  Union  consumption  is a disproportionally large  driver  of \ndeforestation. The  Union  should  therefore  take  action  to minimise  global  deforestation and  forest  degradation  \ndriven  by its consumption of  certain commodities and  products and  thereby seek  to reduce its  contribution to  \ngreenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity loss as well as promote sustainable production and \nconsumption patterns in the Union and globally. To have the greatest impact, Union policy should aim at \ninfluencing the global market, not only supply chains to the Union.

Between 1990 and 2008, the Union was responsible for 10% of worldwide deforestation linked to the production of goods or services, making its consumption a disproportionately large driver of deforestation. Despite a decreasing relative share, the Union's consumption remains a critical area of concern. To address this, the Union aims to minimize global deforestation and forest degradation driven by its consumption through promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns, both within the Union and globally. This involves influencing the global market beyond just the supply chains to the Union, and establishing partnerships and efficient international cooperation, including free trade agreements, with both producer and consumer countries."
How can the European Union support producer countries in addressing root causes of deforestation?,"According to the context information, the European Union can support producer countries in addressing root causes of deforestation by engaging in a coordinated approach with them through existing and future partnerships and other relevant cooperation mechanisms. This can include working together to address issues such as weak governance, ineffective law enforcement, and corruption. Additionally, the EU can encourage trade in deforestation-free products and the adoption of similar measures in major consumer countries to avoid products associated with deforestation and forest degradation from being placed on their markets. The EU can also mobilize relevant Union instruments to support producer countries in this regard.","['EN 9.6.2023  Official  Journal  of the European  Union  L 150/ 211  \n \n \n \n \n(27) This  Regulation should  be complementary  to other measures proposed in  the communication  on Stepping up  EU \nAction to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests, in particular working in partnership with producer countries,  \nto support  them  in addressing  root  causes  of deforestation,  such  as weak  governance,  ineffective  law enforcement  \nand corruption, and strengthening international cooperation with major consumer countries by, inter alia , \nencouraging trade in deforestation -free products and the adoption of similar measures, to avoid products \ncoming  from  supply  chains  associated  with  deforestation  and forest  degradation  being  placed  on their  markets.'

How does the EUDR aim to reduce the Union's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity loss?,"According to the provided context, the EUDR aims to reduce the Union's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity loss by minimizing global deforestation and forest degradation driven by its consumption of certain commodities and products. This is to be achieved by promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns in the Union and globally, influencing the global market, and establishing partnerships and efficient international cooperation, including free trade agreements, with producer and consumer countries. The EUDR also aims to reduce the Union consumption footprint on land and encourage the consumption of products from deforestation-free supply chains. The scope of the regulation includes commodities and products produced within the Union as well as those imported to the Union. The EUDR is part of the external dimension of the European Green Deal and takes into account existing global agreements, commitments, and frameworks contributing to the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation.","['EN 9.6.2023  Official  Journal  of the European  Union  L 150/ 209  \n \n(18) The Union imported and consumed one third of the globally traded agricultural products associated with \ndeforestation between 1990 and 2008. Over that period, Union consumption was responsible for 10  % of \nworldwide deforestation associated with the production of goods or the provision of services. Even if the \nrelative  share  of Union  consumption  is decreasing,  Union  consumption  is a disproportionally large  driver  of \ndeforestation. The  Union  should  therefore  take  action  to minimise  global  deforestation and  forest  degradation  \ndriven  by its consumption of  certain commodities and  products and  thereby seek  to reduce its  contribution to  \ngreenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity loss as well as promote sustainable production and \nconsumption patterns in the Union and globally. To have the greatest impact, Union policy should aim at \ninfluencing the global market, not only supply chains to the Union. Partnerships and efficient international \ncooperation, including free trade agreements, with producer and consumer countries are fundamental in that  \nrespect.  \n \n \n(19) The Union is committed to promoting and implementing  ambitious environment and climate policies across the  \nworld,  in accordance  with  the Charter  of Fundamental  Rights  of the European  Union,  in particular  Article  37 \nthereof  which  provides  that  a high  level  of environmental  protection  and the improvement  of the quality  of the \nenvironment  is to be integrated  into  the policies  of the Union  and ensured  in accordance  with  the principle  of \nsustainable development.'
 'The  scope of  this Regulation should therefore  \ninclude  commodities and products produced within the Union as well as commodities and products imported to  \nthe Union.  \n \n(24) The challenges the world is facing in climate change and biodiversity loss can only be dealt with by global \naction. The Union should be a strong global actor, leading both by example as well as by taking the lead in \ninternational cooperation to create an open and fair multilateral system where sustainable trade acts as a \nkey enabler of the green transition to fight climate change and reverse biodiversity loss.'
 '(13) Combating  deforestation  and forest  degradation  constitutes  an important  part  of the package  of measures  needed  \nto reduce  greenhouse  gas emissions  and to comply  with  the Union’s  commitments  under  the European  Green \nDeal  as well  as with  the Paris  Agreement  adopted  under  the United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on Climate  \nChange  (3) (the  ‘Paris  Agreement’),  and the Eighth  Environment  Action  Programme  adopted  by Decision  (EU)  \n2022/591  of the European  Parliament  and of the Council  (4),'

 'In its communication  of 23 July 2019  on Stepping  up EU Action  to Protect  and Restore  \nthe World’s Forests (‘Communication  on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests’), the  \nCommission identified as  a priority the  reduction of  the Union consumption footprint on  land  and encouraged  \nthe consumption of products from deforestation -free supply chains in the Union. In its communication of  \n11 December  2019  on the European Green  Deal,  the Commission set  out a new  growth strategy that  aims  to \ntransform the Union into a fair and prosperous society, with a modern, resource -efficient and competitive \neconomy  built  on sustainable  and rule -based  free  trade,  where  there  are no net emissions  of greenhouse  gases  \nin 2050, where economic growth is decoupled from resource use and no person or place is left behind. It aims to  \nprotect,  conserve  and enhance  the Union’s  natural  capital,  and protect  the health  and well -being  of citizens  and \nfuture generations from environment -related  risks and impacts. Furthermore, the European Green Deal aims to  \nprovide  citizens  and future  generations  with,  inter  alia, fresh  air, clean  water,  healthy  soil and biodiversity.'

Operators who, on the basis of the due diligence exercised in accordance with Article 8, \nconclude that the relevant products comply with Article 3 shall, before placing the relevant products on the \nmarket or exporting them, make available a due diligence statement to the competent authorities through the \ninformation system referred to in Article 33. Such electronically available and transmittable due diligence \nstatement shall contain the information set out in Annex II for the relevant products and a declaration by the \noperator that the operator exercised due diligence and that no or only a negligible risk was found.  \n \n3. By making available the due diligence statement to competent authorities, the operator shall assume \nresponsibility for the compliance of the relevant product with Article 3. Operators shall keep a record of the due \ndiligence statements for five years from the date the statement is submitted through the information system \nreferred to in Article 33.  \n \n4. Operators shall not place relevant products on the market or export them where one or more of the \nfollowing cases apply:  \n \n(a) the relevant products are non -compliant;  \n \n(b) the exercise of due diligence has revealed a non -negligible risk that the relevant products are non -compliant;  \n \n(c) the operator was unable to fulfil the obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2.  \n \n5.'

 'Moreover,  in view  of the limited  differences  between  the data  that  are to be made  available  to \ncustoms authorities and that are  to be included in  the due  diligence statement, it  is appropriate  to propose also a  \n‘business -to-government  ’ approach  whereby  traders  and economic  operators  make  available  the due diligence  \nstatement  of a relevant  product  through  the national  single  window  environment  for customs  and that statement  \nis automatically  transmitted  to the information  system  under  this Regulation  used  by competent  authorities. \nCustoms authorities and  competent authorities should  contribute to  the determination of  the data  to be trans\xad  \nmitted  and any other  technical  requirement.'

For that  purpose,  except \nwhere  the due diligence statement is made available through the electronic interface referred to in Article  28(2), the  \nperson lodging the customs declaration for release for free circulation or export of a relevant product shall make \navailable to customs authorities the reference number of the due diligence statement assigned to that relevant product  \nby the information  system  referred  to in Article  33. \n \n5.'
 '(49) On the basis of a systemic approach, operators should take the appropriate steps in order to ensure that the \nrelevant products that they intend to place on the market comply with the deforestation -free and legality \nrequirements of this Regulation. To that end, operators should establish and implement due diligence \nsystems. Those due diligence systems should include three elements, namely information requirements, \nrisk assessment and risk mitigation measures, complemented by reporting obligations. The due diligence \nsystems should be designed to provide access to information about the sources and suppliers of the \ncommodities and products being placed on the market, including information demonstrating that the \nabsence of deforestation and forest degradation and legality requirements are fulfilled, inter alia , by \nidentifying the country of production or parts thereof and including the geolocation coordinates of relevant \nplots of land.']","The due diligence statement submitted by operators before placing relevant products on the market or exporting them must include the following information as set out in Annex II for the relevant products: 1. A declaration by the operator that they have exercised due diligence in accordance with Article 8. 2. A statement indicating that no or only a negligible risk was found regarding the compliance of the relevant products with Article 3. Additionally, operators are responsible for keeping a record of the due diligence statements for five years from the date the statement is submitted through the information system referred to in Article 33. Operators must also ensure that they do not place relevant products on the market or export them if the products are non-compliant, if due diligence reveals a non-negligible risk of non-compliance, or if the operator was unable to fulfill the obligations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. Furthermore, operators must immediately inform the competent authorities and traders if they obtain new information indicating a risk of non-compliance. They are also required to communicate all necessary information to demonstrate that due diligence was exercised to operators and traders further down the supply chain, including the reference numbers of the due diligence statements associated with those products."
