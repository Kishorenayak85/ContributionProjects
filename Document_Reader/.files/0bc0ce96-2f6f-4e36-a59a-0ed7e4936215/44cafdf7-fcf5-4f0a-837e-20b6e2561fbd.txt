from time to time. Now, as all existing Group D employees who were in 6th CPC GP 1300 and GP 
1650 have been moved to Level 1 (GP 1800) irrespective of their service, the personal promotion 
which was available at GP 1650 on completion of 8 years of service in GP 1300 has been removed 
from the new policy. In the given circumstances, SEDC has introduced GP 2000 in Group C, special

completed 10, 20, 27 and 33/35 years respectively from the date of joining (DOJ).
