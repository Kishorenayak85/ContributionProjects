How does the Union's consumption of certain commodities and products contribute to global deforestation?," (18)  The Union imported and consumed one third of the globally traded agricultural products associated with 
deforestation between 1990 and 2008. Over that period, Union consumption was responsible for 10 % of 
worldwide deforestation associated with the production of goods or the provision of services. Even if the 
relative share of Union consumption is decreasing, Union consumption is a disproportionally large driver of 
deforestation. The Union should therefore take action to minimise global deforestation and forest degradation 
driven by its consumption of certain commodities and products and thereby seek to reduce its contribution to 
greenhouse gas emissions and global biodiversity loss as well as promote sustainable production and 
consumption patterns in the Union and globally. To have the greatest impact, Union policy should aim at 
influencing the global market, not only supply chains to the Union. Partnerships and efficient international 
cooperation, including free trade agreements, with producer and consumer countries are fundamental in that 
respect.  
(19)  The Union is committed to promoting and implementing ambitious environment and climate policies across the 
world, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 37 
thereof which provides that a high level of environmental protection and the improvement of the quality of the 
environment is to be integrated into the policies of the Union and ensured in accordance with the principle of 
sustainable development. As part of the external dimension of the European Green Deal, action under this 
Regulation should take into account the importance of existing global agreements, commitments and frameworks 
contributing to the reduction of deforestation and forest degradation such as the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 
2017-2030 and its Global Forest Goals, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the 
Paris Agreement, the CBD and its Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework, the global Strategic Plan for 
Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, 
as well as the multilateral framework in support of tackling the root causes of deforestation and forest degra ­
dation, such as the SDGs and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.  
(20)  Halting deforestation and restoring degraded forests is an essential part of the SDGs. This Regulation should 
contribute in particular to meeting the goals regarding life on land (SDG 15), climate action (SDG 13), 
responsible consumption and production (SDG 12), zero hunger (SDG 2) and good health and well-being 
(SDG 3). The relevant target 15.2 to halt deforestation by 2020 has not been met, underlining the urgency of 
ambitious and effective action.  
(21)  This Regulation should also respond to the New York Declaration on Forests, a non-legally binding political 
declaration that endorses a global timeline to cut natural forest loss in half by 2020 and to strive to end it by 
2030. The Declaration was endorsed by dozens of governments, many of the world’s biggest companies, and 
influential civil society and indigenous peoples’ organisations. It also called on the private sector to meet the goal 
of eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities such as palm oil, soy, paper and 
beef products by no later than 2020, a goal that was not achieved. In addition, this Regulation should contribute 
to the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2017-2030 whose Global Forest Goal 1 is to reverse the loss of forest cover 
worldwide through sustainable forest management, including protection, restoration, afforestation and refores ­
tation, and increase efforts to prevent forest degradation and contribute to the global effort of addressing climate 
change.  
(22)  This Regulation should also respond to the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forests and Land Use issued at the 
November 2021 UN Climate Change Conference, which recognises that ‘to meet our land use, climate, biodi ­
versity and Sustainable Development Goals, both globally and nationally, will require transformative further 
action in the interconnected areas of sustainable production and consumption; infrastructure development; 
trade, finance and investment; and support for smallholders, indigenous peoples, and local communities ’. The 
signatories committed to working collectively to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by 2030 and 
stressed that they would strengthen their shared efforts to facilitate trade and development policies, internationally 
and domestically, that promote sustainable development and sustainable commodity production and 
consumption, and that work to countries’ mutual benefit.  
(23)  As a member of World Trade Organization (WTO), the Union is committed to promoting a universal, rule-based, 
open, transparent, predictable, inclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system under the 
WTO, as well as an open, sustainable, and assertive trade policy. The scope of this Regulation should therefore 
include commodities and products produced within the Union as well as commodities and products imported to 
the Union.EN  9.6.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 150/209","The Union's consumption of certain commodities and products significantly contributes to global deforestation due to its large share of globally traded agricultural products associated with deforestation. Between 1990 and 2008, the Union was responsible for 10% of worldwide deforestation linked to the production of goods or services, making its consumption a disproportionately large driver of deforestation. Despite a decreasing relative share, the Union's consumption remains a critical area of concern. To address this, the Union aims to minimize global deforestation and forest degradation driven by its consumption through promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns, both within the Union and globally. This involves influencing the global market beyond just the supply chains to the Union, and establishing partnerships and efficient international cooperation, including free trade agreements, with both producer and consumer countries."
How can the European Union support producer countries in addressing root causes of deforestation?," 
(24)  The challenges the world is facing in climate change and biodiversity loss can only be dealt with by global action. 
The Union should be a strong global actor, leading both by example as well as by taking the lead in international 
cooperation to create an open and fair multilateral system where sustainable trade acts as a key enabler of the 
green transition to fight climate change and reverse biodiversity loss.  
(25)  This Regulation also follows the communications of the Commission of 22 June 2022 on the power of trade 
partnerships: together for green and just economic growth and of 18 February 2021 on Trade Policy Review – 
An Open, Sustainable and Assertive Trade Policy, which stated that with new internal and external challenges and 
more particularly a new, more sustainable growth model as defined by the European Green Deal and the 
European Digital Strategy, contained in the communication of the Commission of 19 February 2020 on 
Shaping Europe’s digital future, the Union needs a new trade policy strategy – one that will support achieving 
its domestic and external policy objectives and promote greater sustainability in line with its commitment to fully 
implement the SDGs. Trade policy needs to play a full role in the Union’s recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic 
and in the green and digital transformations of the economy and towards building a more resilient Union in the 
world.  
(26)  In line with its communication of 22 June 2022 on the power of trade partnerships: together for green and just 
economic growth, the Commission is stepping up engagement with trade partners to foster compliance with 
international labour and environmental standards. The communication envisages robust chapters on sustainable 
development, containing clauses on deforestation and forest degradation. Ensuring enforcement of current and 
the conclusion of new trade agreements with such chapters will complement the objectives of this Regulation.  
(27)  This Regulation should be complementary to other measures proposed in the communication on Stepping up EU 
Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests, in particular working in partnership with producer countries, 
to support them in addressing root causes of deforestation, such as weak governance, ineffective law enforcement 
and corruption, and strengthening international cooperation with major consumer countries by,  inter alia , 
encouraging trade in deforestation-free products and the adoption of similar measures, to avoid products 
coming from supply chains associated with deforestation and forest degradation being placed on their markets.  
(28)  This Regulation should take into account the principle of policy coherence for development and serve to promote 
and facilitate cooperation with developing countries, particularly with the least developed countries (LDCs),  inter 
alia  through the provision of technical and financial assistance, where possible and relevant.  
(29)  In coordination with Member States, the Commission should continue to work in partnership with producer 
countries, and more generally in cooperation with international organisations and bodies as well as with relevant 
stakeholders active on the ground through multi-stakeholder dialogues. The Commission should reinforce its 
support and incentives with regard to protecting forests and the transition to deforestation-free production, 
acknowledging and strengthening the role and rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, smallholders 
and micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), improving governance and land tenure, increasing law 
enforcement and promoting sustainable forest management, with an emphasis on closer-to-nature forestry prac ­
tices, based on science-based indicators and thresholds, ecotourism, climate-resilient agriculture, diversification, 
agro-ecology and agroforestry. In doing so, the Commission should fully recognise the role and rights of 
indigenous peoples and local communities in protecting forests, taking into account the principle of free, 
prior and informed consent (FPIC). Building upon the experience and lessons learned in the context of 
existing initiatives, the Union and the Member States should work towards partnerships with producer countries, 
at their request, and address global challenges while meeting local needs and paying attention to the challenges 
faced by smallholders, in line with the communication on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the 
World’s Forests. The partnership approach should help producer countries and parts thereof in protecting, 
restoring and sustainably using forest, hence contributing to the objective of this Regulation to reduce defores ­
tation and forest degradation, including through the use of digital technologies, geospatial information and 
capacity building.EN  L 150/210 Official Journal of the European Union 9.6.2023","The European Union can support producer countries in addressing the root causes of deforestation by: 1. Enhancing engagement with trade partners to ensure compliance with international labour and environmental standards, including clauses on deforestation and forest degradation in trade agreements. 2. Working in partnership with producer countries to tackle weak governance, ineffective law enforcement, and corruption. 3. Strengthening international cooperation with major consumer countries to encourage trade in deforestation-free products and adopting similar measures to prevent products from deforestation and forest degradation entering their markets. 4. Providing technical and financial assistance to developing countries, especially the least developed countries (LDCs), to promote and facilitate cooperation. 5. Continuing to work in partnership with producer countries, international organisations, and stakeholders through multi-stakeholder dialogues to support forest protection and transition to deforestation-free production. This includes acknowledging and strengthening the rights of indigenous peoples, local communities, smallholders, and SMEs, improving governance and land tenure, increasing law enforcement, and promoting sustainable forest management practices. 6. Emphasizing the importance of science-based indicators and thresholds for closer-to-nature forestry practices, ecotourism, climate-resilient agriculture, diversification, agro-ecology, and agroforestry. 7. Recognizing the role and rights of indigenous peoples and local communities in forest protection, adhering to the principle of free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC). 8. Building upon existing initiatives to form partnerships with producer countries, addressing global challenges while meeting local needs and considering the challenges faced by smallholders."
How should the EU Observatory on deforestation facilitate access to information on supply chains?," 
(30)  Operators and traders should be bound by the obligations under this Regulation regardless of whether the 
making available on the market takes place through traditional or online means. This Regulation should 
therefore ensure that in every supply chain there is an operator within the meaning of this Regulation who is 
established in the Union and can be held accountable in the event of non-fulfilment of the obligations under this 
Regulation. The Commission and the Member States should monitor the implementation of this Regulation and 
identify whether digital and technological developments require further specifications or initiatives, as appropriate, 
in the future.  
(31)  Another important action announced in the communication on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore 
the World’s Forests is the establishment of the EU Observatory on deforestation, forest degradation, changes in 
the world’s forest cover and associated drivers (‘EU Observatory’) launched by the Commission in order to better 
monitor changes in the world’s forest cover and related drivers. Building on existing monitoring tools, including 
Copernicus products and other publicly or privately available sources, the EU Observatory should facilitate access 
to information on supply chains for public entities, consumers and business, providing easy-to-understand data 
and information linking deforestation, forest degradation and changes in the world’s forest cover to Union 
demand for, and trade in, commodities and products. The EU Observatory should thus support the implemen ­
tation of this Regulation by providing scientific evidence with regard to global deforestation and forest degra ­
dation and related trade. The EU Observatory should provide for land cover maps, including with time series 
since the cut-off date defined in this Regulation, and a range of classes allowing landscape composition to be 
examined. The EU Observatory should participate in the development of an early warning system combining 
research and monitoring capacity. As regards this Regulation, when technically feasible, the objective of the early 
warning system should be to be part of a platform that can assist the competent authorities, operators, traders 
and other relevant stakeholders and that can provide continuous monitoring and early notification of possible 
deforestation or forest degradation activities. That platform should be operational as soon as possible. The EU 
Observatory should cooperate with the competent authorities, relevant international organisations and bodies, 
research institutes, non-governmental organisations, operators, traders, third countries and other relevant stake ­
holders.  
(32)  The existing Union legal framework focuses on tackling illegal logging and associated trade and does not address 
deforestation directly. It consists of Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the 
Council (  7 ) and Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 (  8 ). Both Regulations were evaluated in a Fitness Check 
which determined that, while the legislation has had a positive impact on forest governance, the objectives of the 
two Regulations – namely to curb illegal logging and related trade, and to reduce the consumption of illegally 
harvested timber in the Union – have not been met and it was concluded that focusing solely on the legality of 
timber was not sufficient to meet the set objectives.  
(33)  Available reports confirm that a sizeable part of ongoing deforestation is legal in accordance with the laws of the 
country of production. A report by the Forest Policy Trade and Finance Initiative published in May 2021 
estimates that between 2013 and 2019, around 30 % of deforestation destined to commercial agriculture in 
tropical countries was legal. Available data tend to focus on countries with weak governance – the global share of 
deforestation that is illegal might be lower, but already provide clear data signalling that leaving out deforestation 
that is legal in the country of production undermines the effectiveness of policy measures.  
(34)  The impact assessment of possible policy measures to address Union-driven deforestation and forest degradation, 
the Council conclusions of 16 December 2019 and the resolution of the European Parliament of 22 October 
2020 clearly identify the need to establish deforestation and forest degradation as the guiding criteria for future 
Union measures. A focus only on legality could potentially entail a risk of lowered environmental standards with 
a view to obtaining market access. Therefore, the new Union legal framework should address both legality and 
whether the production of relevant commodities and relevant products is deforestation-free.  
(35)  The definition of ‘deforestation-free ’ should be sufficiently broad to cover deforestation and forest degradation, 
should provide legal clarity, and should be measurable based on quantitative, objective and internationally 
recognised data.EN  9.6.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 150/211  
( 7 ) Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 laying down the obligations of 
operators who place timber and timber products on the market (OJ L 295, 12.11.2010, p. 23).  
( 8 ) Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 of 20 December 2005 on the establishment of a FLEGT licensing scheme for imports of 
timber into the European Community (OJ L 347, 30.12.2005, p. 1).","The EU Observatory on deforestation should facilitate access to information on supply chains by leveraging existing monitoring tools like Copernicus products and other sources to provide comprehensive, easy-to-understand data and information. This should include linking deforestation, forest degradation, and changes in the world’s forest cover directly to Union demand for, and trade in, commodities and products. The Observatory is expected to support the implementation of the EUDR by offering scientific evidence related to global deforestation and forest degradation and their trade connections. It should provide detailed land cover maps with time series analysis post the cut-off date defined by the regulation, and enable the examination of landscape composition through a variety of classes. Additionally, the Observatory should aid in the development of an early warning system that combines research and monitoring capabilities to offer continuous monitoring and early notifications of potential deforestation or forest degradation activities. This system should aim to assist competent authorities, operators, traders, and other stakeholders by being part of a platform for continuous monitoring. Cooperation with competent authorities, international organizations, research institutes, NGOs, operators, traders, third countries, and other stakeholders is crucial for the Observatory's success in facilitating access to supply chain information."
What specific guidelines should the Commission develop to clarify the interpretation of agricultural use in relation to the conversion of forested land?," (36)  For the purposes of this Regulation, agricultural use should be defined as the use of land for the purpose of 
agriculture. In this regard, the Commission should develop guidelines in order to clarify the interpretation of this 
definition, in particular in relation to the conversion of forest to land the purpose of which is not agricultural use.  
(37)  In line with FAO definitions, agroforestry systems, including where crops are grown under tree cover, as well as 
agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral and agrosilvopastoral systems, should not be considered forests, but as constituting 
agricultural use.  
(38)  This Regulation should cover commodities the Union consumption of which is the most relevant in terms of 
driving global deforestation and forest degradation and for which a Union policy intervention could bring the 
highest benefits per unit value of trade. An extensive review of relevant scientific literature, namely of primary 
sources estimating the impact of Union consumption on global deforestation and linking that environmental 
footprint to specific commodities, was carried out as a part of the study supporting the impact assessment for 
this Regulation and cross-checked by means of extensive consultation with stakeholders. That process delivered a 
first list of eight commodities. Wood was directly included in the scope as it was already covered by Regulation 
(EU) No 995/2010. According to a recent research paper (  9 ) used for the efficiency analysis, seven commodities 
represent the largest share of Union-driven deforestation of the eight commodities analysed in that research 
paper: oil palm (34,0 %), soya (32,8 %), wood (8,6 %), cocoa (7,5 %), coffee (7,0 %), cattle (5,0 %) and 
rubber (3,4 %).  
(39)  To ensure that this Regulation achieves its objectives, it is important to ensure that feed used for livestock falling 
within the scope of this Regulation does not lead to deforestation. Therefore, operators placing on the market or 
exporting relevant products that contain or have been made using cattle which have been fed with relevant 
products that contain or have been made using other relevant commodities or relevant products, should ensure, 
as part of their due diligence system, that the feed is deforestation-free. In that case, geolocation requirements 
under this Regulation should be limited to referring to the geographical location of each of the establishments 
where the cattle were raised, and no geolocation information should be required for the feed itself. If the 
competent authority obtains or is made aware of relevant information, including information based on 
substantiated concerns submitted by third parties, that there is a risk of the feed not being in compliance 
with this Regulation, the competent authority should immediately request detailed information on such feed. 
If the feed has already been subject to due diligence in a previous step of the supply chain, operators should use 
as evidence the relevant invoices, reference numbers of relevant due diligence statements or any other relevant 
documentation indicating that the feed is deforestation-free and they could be required to make that evidence 
available to competent authorities upon request. The evidence should cover the lifetime of the animals, up to a 
maximum of five years.  
(40)  Bearing in mind that the use of recycled relevant commodities and relevant products should be encouraged, and 
that including such commodities and products in the scope of this Regulation would place a disproportionate 
burden on operators, used commodities and products that have completed their lifecycle, and would otherwise be 
disposed of as waste, as defined in Article 3, point (1), of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and 
of the Council (  10 ) should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. However, this should not apply to 
certain by-products of the manufacturing process.  
(41)  This Regulation should lay down obligations concerning relevant commodities and relevant products in order to 
effectively combat deforestation and forest degradation, and to promote deforestation-free supply chains, while 
taking into account the protection of human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, 
both in the Union and in third countries.  
(42)  When assessing the risk of non-compliance of relevant commodities and relevant products intended to be placed 
on the market or exported, violations of human rights that are associated with deforestation or forest degra ­
dation, including rights of indigenous peoples, local communities and customary tenure rights holders, should be 
taken into account.EN  L 150/212 Official Journal of the European Union 9.6.2023

forestry commodities 2005-2017 (Version 1.0). Zenodo.  
( 10 ) Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain 
Directives (OJ L 312, 22.11.2008, p. 3).","The Commission should develop guidelines that clearly define agricultural use in relation to the conversion of forested land to ensure it does not contribute to deforestation. These guidelines should distinguish between agricultural use and the conversion of forests for non-agricultural purposes. Specifically, they should clarify that agroforestry systems, including crops grown under tree cover, and agrisilvicultural, silvopastoral, and agrosilvopastoral systems, are considered agricultural use and not forest land. This distinction is crucial for regulating commodities and ensuring that Union consumption does not drive global deforestation. The guidelines should also address the scope of commodities covered by the regulation, emphasizing the need for deforestation-free supply chains and considering the impact on human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities."
How should the definition of forest degradation be based on internationally agreed concepts and ensure that associated obligations are easily fulfilled?," (43)  Many international organisations and bodies, such as the FAO, the IPCC, the UN Environment Programme, and 
the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, have been active, and international agreements, such as 
the Paris Agreement and the CBD, have been concluded in the field of deforestation and forest degradation, and 
the definitions in this Regulation build on that work.  
(44)  It is essential that this Regulation also address the issue of forest degradation. The definition of forest degradation 
should be based on internationally agreed concepts and ensure that the associated obligations can be easily 
fulfilled by operators and competent authorities. Those obligations should be operationally measurable and 
verifiable, as well as clear and unambiguous, to provide legal certainty. In that context, this Regulation should 
focus on key elements of forest degradation that are measurable and verifiable, and that are particularly relevant 
to avoid environmental impacts, based on the most up-to-date scientific data. For that purpose, the definition of 
forest degradation should build on internationally agreed concepts that are defined by the FAO. The definition of 
forest degradation should be reviewed, in accordance with this Regulation, to assess whether it should be 
extended to cover a broader scope of forest degradation drivers and of forest ecosystems worldwide to further 
support the environmental objectives of this Regulation, taking into account progress made in international 
discussions on the matter, as well as the diversity of forest ecosystems and practices around the world. The 
review should be conducted on the basis of an in-depth analysis, in close cooperation with the Member States, 
and in consultation with relevant stakeholders, international organisations and bodies and the scientific 
community.  
(45)  This Regulation should ensure a proper balance between the protection of the legitimate expectations of 
operators and traders placing relevant commodities and relevant products on the market or exporting them, 
while minimising sudden disruption to supply chains, and the fundamental right to protection of the 
environment as established in Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. To 
that end, a cut-off date should be set to provide a basis for the evaluation of whether land concerned has 
been subject to deforestation or forest degradation, so that no commodities and products falling within the scope 
of this Regulation can be placed on the market or exported, if they were produced on land subject to defores ­
tation or forest degradation after that date.  
(46)  The cut-off date should correspond to existing international commitments set out in the SDGs and the New York 
Declaration on Forests, which pursue the ambitions of halting deforestation, restoring degraded forests and 
substantially increasing afforestation and reforestation globally by 2020, and thus should be set on 31 December 
2020. That date is also consistent with the Commission’s announcement of its intention to combat deforestation 
in the communication on Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests, the European Green 
Deal, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 as well as in the Farm to Fork strategy. In line with the precautionary 
principle, the cut-off date indicated in the Commission proposal for this Regulation precedes the date of entry 
into force of this Regulation. The cut-off date was chosen in order to prevent an anticipated acceleration of 
activities leading to deforestation and forest degradation between the announcement in the Commission proposal 
and the date of entry into force of this Regulation. This Regulation should acknowledge the environmental 
objective pursued and confirm the proposed cut-off date to ensure that the producers and operators which 
have caused deforestation and forest degradation during the period of negotiation of this Regulation are not 
allowed to place the relevant commodities and relevant products concerned on the market or to export them.  
(47)  The limitations on the exercise of the fundamental rights and the protection of the legitimate expectations of 
operators and traders resulting from the choice of the cut-off date should be proportionate to, and strictly 
necessary for, pursuing the general interest objective of environmental protection. To contribute to that objective, 
this Regulation should not apply to relevant commodities and relevant products produced before the date of 
entry into force of this Regulation. The deferred application of provisions of this Regulation governing obligations 
for operators and traders who intend to place relevant commodities and relevant products on the market or to 
export them also provides them a reasonable period of time to adapt to the new requirements of this Regulation.  
(48)  To strengthen the Union’s contribution to halting deforestation and forest degradation, and to ensure that 
relevant products from supply chains related to deforestation and forest degradation are not placed on the 
market or exported, relevant products should not be placed or made available on the market or exported 
unless they are deforestation-free and have been produced in accordance with the relevant legislation of the 
country of production. To confirm that this is the case, they should always be accompanied by a due diligence 
statement.EN  9.6.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 150/213","The definition of forest degradation should be based on internationally agreed concepts, such as those defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), to ensure that the associated obligations are easily fulfilled by operators and competent authorities. These obligations should be operationally measurable and verifiable, as well as clear and unambiguous, to provide legal certainty. This approach allows for a focus on key elements of forest degradation that are measurable and verifiable, and that are particularly relevant to avoid environmental impacts, based on the most up-to-date scientific data. Additionally, the definition should be reviewed periodically to assess whether it should be extended to cover a broader scope of forest degradation drivers and of forest ecosystems worldwide, in order to further support the environmental objectives of the Regulation. This review should be conducted in close cooperation with Member States, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, international organisations, and the scientific community, taking into account progress made in international discussions, as well as the diversity of forest ecosystems and practices around the world."
What are the three elements that operators should include in their due diligence systems according to the EUDR?," 
(49)  On the basis of a systemic approach, operators should take the appropriate steps in order to ensure that the 
relevant products that they intend to place on the market comply with the deforestation-free and legality 
requirements of this Regulation. To that end, operators should establish and implement due diligence systems. 
Those due diligence systems should include three elements, namely information requirements, risk assessment and 
risk mitigation measures, complemented by reporting obligations. The due diligence systems should be designed 
to provide access to information about the sources and suppliers of the commodities and products being placed 
on the market, including information demonstrating that the absence of deforestation and forest degradation and 
legality requirements are fulfilled,  inter alia , by identifying the country of production or parts thereof and 
including the geolocation coordinates of relevant plots of land. Those geolocation coordinates that rely on 
timing, positioning and/or Earth observation could make use of space data and services delivered under the 
Union’s Space programme (EGNOS/Galileo and Copernicus). On the basis of that information, operators should 
carry out a risk assessment. Where a risk is identified, operators should mitigate that risk to achieve no or only a 
negligible risk. The operator should only be allowed to place relevant products on the market or export them if 
the operator concludes, after exercising due diligence, that there is no or only a negligible risk that the relevant 
products do not comply with this Regulation.  
(50)  When sourcing products, reasonable efforts should be undertaken to ensure that a fair price is paid to producers, 
in particular smallholders, so as to enable a living income and effectively address poverty as a root cause of 
deforestation.  
(51)  Operators should formally take responsibility for the compliance of the relevant products that they intend to 
place on the market or export by making available due diligence statements. This Regulation should provide a 
template for such statements. Such due diligence statements are expected to facilitate enforcement of this 
Regulation by the competent authorities and courts as well as increase compliance by operators.  
(52)  In order to recognise good practice, certification or other third-party verified schemes could be used in the risk 
assessment procedure. They should not, however, substitute the operator’s responsibility as regards due diligence.  
(53)  Traders should be responsible for collecting and keeping information to ensure the transparency of the supply 
chain of relevant products which they make available on the market. Non-SME traders have a significant influence 
on supply chains and play an important role in ensuring that supply chains are deforestation-free. They should 
therefore have the same obligations as operators, take responsibility for the compliance of the relevant products 
with this Regulation and ensure, prior to making the relevant products available on the market, that they have 
exercised due diligence in accordance with this Regulation and have concluded that there is no or only a 
negligible risk that the relevant products do not comply with this Regulation.  
(54)  In order to foster transparency and facilitate enforcement, operators which do not fall under the categories of 
SMEs, including microenterprises, or natural persons should, on an annual basis, publicly report on their due 
diligence system, including on the steps taken to fulfil their obligations.  
(55)  Operators should be able to receive substantiated concerns from interested parties, including by electronic means, 
and should thoroughly investigate all substantiated concerns received.  
(56)  Other Union legal acts that provide for due diligence requirements in the value chain with regard to adverse 
impacts on human rights or on the environment should apply in so far as there are no specific provisions with 
the same objective, nature and effect in this Regulation which can be adapted in the light of future amendments 
to Union legal acts. The existence of this Regulation should not exclude the application of other Union legal acts 
that lay down requirements regarding value chain due diligence. Where such other Union legal acts provide for 
more specific provisions or add requirements to the provisions laid down in this Regulation, such provisions 
should be applied in conjunction with this Regulation. Furthermore, where this Regulation contains more specific 
provisions, they should not be interpreted in a way that undermines the effective application of other Union legal 
acts on due diligence or the achievement of their general aim. It should be possible for the Commission to issue 
clear and easy to understand guidelines for the compliance of operators and traders, in particular SMEs, with this 
Regulation.  
(57)  Respecting the rights of indigenous peoples with regard to forests and the principle of FPIC, including as set out 
in the UN Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, contributes towards protecting biodiversity, mitigating 
climate change and addressing the related public interest concerns. Indigenous peoples possess traditional 
knowledge of ecological and medical value, and very often offer a model of sustainable use of forest resources.EN  L 150/214 Official Journal of the European Union 9.6.2023","The three elements that operators should include in their due diligence systems according to the EUDR are: information requirements, risk assessment, and risk mitigation measures."
How can operators falling within the scope of other Union legal acts ensure compliance with reporting obligations under the EUDR?," 
This can contribute to in-situ conservation, in line with the CBD. Furthermore, studies suggest that forest-dwelling 
indigenous peoples play a dual role in combating climate change: first, they normally resist the occupation and 
deforestation of the lands they have inhabited for generations; and second, some indigenous communities 
consider it their responsibility to protect the forests in order to mitigate climate change.  
(58)  The principles set out in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development of the UN, in particular, 
Principle 10 concerning the importance of public awareness and participation in environmental issues and 
Principle 22 concerning the vital role of indigenous people in environmental management and development, 
are important in the context of securing sustainable forest management.  
(59)  The concept of FPIC of indigenous peoples has been developed over the years following the approval of the 
International Labour Organisation Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (No 169), and it is reflected 
in the UN Declaration on the Protection of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It aims to be a safeguard to ensure 
that potential impacts on indigenous peoples will be considered in the decision-making process of projects 
affecting them.  
(60)  Operators falling within the scope of other Union legal acts that set out due diligence requirements in the value 
chain with regard to adverse impacts on human rights or on the environment should be in a position to fulfil the 
reporting obligations under this Regulation by including the required information when reporting under the other 
Union legal acts.  
(61)  The responsibility for enforcing this Regulation should lie with the Member States, and the competent authorities 
of the Member States should ensure full compliance with this Regulation. A uniform enforcement of this 
Regulation as regards relevant products entering or leaving the market can only be achieved through systematic 
exchange of information and cooperation amongst competent authorities, customs authorities and the 
Commission.  
(62)  The effective and efficient implementation and enforcement of this Regulation are essential to achieving its goals. 
To that end, the Commission should set up and manage an information system to support the operators and the 
competent authorities in presenting and accessing the necessary information on relevant products placed on the 
market. The operators should submit the due diligence statements through the information system. The 
information system should be accessible to competent authorities and customs authorities to facilitate the 
fulfilment of their obligations under this Regulation and should facilitate the transfer of information between 
Member States, competent authorities and customs authorities. The non-commercially sensitive data should also 
be accessible to a wider public, subject to the data being anonymised, apart from information concerning the list 
of final judgments against legal persons for infringements of this Regulation and the penalties imposed on them, 
and should be provided in an open and machine-readable format in line with the Union’s Open Data Policy as set 
out in Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  11 ). 
(63)  For the relevant products entering or leaving the market, competent authorities should be tasked with checking 
compliance of relevant products with this Regulation based,  inter alia , on the due diligence statements submitted 
by the operators. The role of customs authorities should be to ensure that a reference to the due diligence 
statement is made available to them where applicable. In addition, as from the moment the electronic interface is 
in place to exchange information between customs authorities and competent authorities, customs authorities 
should examine the status of the due diligence statement after an initial risk analysis has been carried out by 
competent authorities in the information system. Customs authorities should take appropriate action, such as to 
suspend or refuse a relevant commodity or relevant product if requested to do so on the basis of the status of the 
due diligence statement in the information system. That specific organisation of controls renders Chapter VII of 
Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  12 ) inapplicable in so far as the 
application and enforcement of this Regulation is concerned.  
(64)  Member States should ensure that adequate financial resources are always available for the appropriate staffing 
and equipping of the competent authorities. A high level of resources is needed in order to carry out checks 
efficiently and stable resources should be provided at a level appropriate to the enforcement needs at any givenEN  9.6.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 150/215  
( 11 ) Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re-use of public 
sector information (OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56).

(OJ L 169, 25.6.2019, p. 1).","Operators falling within the scope of other Union legal acts that have due diligence requirements related to adverse impacts on human rights or the environment can ensure compliance with the EUDR by integrating the necessary information into their existing reporting under those acts. This approach allows for a streamlined process where operators can fulfill their obligations under the EUDR without duplicating efforts. Additionally, the establishment of an information system by the Commission will support operators and competent authorities by providing a platform for the submission and access of due diligence statements. This system will facilitate compliance checks by competent authorities and customs authorities, ensuring that relevant products on the market adhere to the EUDR's requirements. Operators should therefore make use of this system to submit their due diligence statements, which will be accessible to the necessary authorities for verification purposes. Furthermore, cooperation and information exchange among Member States, competent authorities, and customs authorities are crucial for uniform enforcement of the EUDR."
What criteria should be used to assess the deforestation and forest degradation risk at the level of a country or parts thereof?," moment. Member States should have the possibility to supplement public financing by recovering from the 
relevant economic operators the costs incurred when carrying out checks in relation to relevant commodities and 
relevant products that were found to be non-compliant.  
(65)  This Regulation is without prejudice to other Union legal acts on goods and products entering or leaving the 
market, in particular Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  13 ) as regards 
the powers of customs authorities and customs controls. Importers should be reminded that Articles 220, 254, 
256, 257 and 258 of that Regulation provide that products entering the market that require further processing 
are to be placed under the appropriate customs procedure allowing such processing. Generally, the release for free 
circulation or export should not be deemed to be proof of compliance with Union law, since such a release or 
export does not necessarily include a complete control of compliance.  
(66)  In order to optimise the control process, including by minimising the administrative burden, for relevant products 
entering or leaving the market, it is necessary to set up an interoperable electronic interface that enables the 
automatic transfer of data between customs systems and the information systems of competent authorities. The 
European Union Single Window Environment for Customs is the natural candidate to enable such data transfer. 
The interface should be highly automated and easy-to-use, and should facilitate processes for customs authorities 
and operators. Moreover, in view of the limited differences between the data that are to be made available to 
customs authorities and that are to be included in the due diligence statement, it is appropriate to propose also a 
‘business-to-government ’ approach whereby traders and economic operators make available the due diligence 
statement of a relevant product through the national single window environment for customs and that statement 
is automatically transmitted to the information system under this Regulation used by competent authorities. 
Customs authorities and competent authorities should contribute to the determination of the data to be trans ­
mitted and any other technical requirement.  
(67)  The risk of non-compliant products being placed on the market or exported varies depending on the commodity 
and product as well as on its country of origin and production or parts thereof. Operators sourcing commodities 
and products from countries or parts thereof that present a low risk of growing, harvesting or producing relevant 
commodities in violation of this Regulation should be subject to fewer obligations, thereby reducing compliance 
costs and administrative burden, unless the operator knows or has reason to believe that there is a risk of non- 
compliance with this Regulation. Where a competent authority becomes aware of a risk that this Regulation is 
being circumvented, for example where a relevant commodity or relevant product produced in a high-risk 
country is subsequently processed in a low risk country or parts thereof from where it is placed on or enters 
or leaves the market and the due diligence statement or the customs declaration indicates that the relevant 
commodity or relevant product was produced in a low-risk country, the competent authority should verify by 
means of further checks whether there is any non-compliance and, if necessary, take appropriate action, such as 
the seizure of the relevant commodity or relevant product and the suspension of the placing on the market or of 
the export of the relevant commodity or relevant product, as well as carry out further checks. The competent 
authorities should be required to apply enhanced scrutiny to relevant commodities and relevant products from 
high-risk countries or parts thereof.  
(68)  Furthermore, the Commission should assess the deforestation and forest degradation risk at the level of a country 
or parts thereof based on a range of criteria that reflect quantitative, objective and internationally recognised data, 
and indications that the countries are actively engaged in fighting deforestation and forest degradation. Such 
benchmarking information should make it easier for operators in the Union to exercise due diligence and for 
competent authorities to monitor and enforce compliance, while also providing an incentive for producer 
countries to increase the sustainability of their agricultural production systems and reduce their deforestation 
impact. This should help to make supply chains more transparent and sustainable. The benchmarking system 
should be based on a three-tier system for classification of countries as low, standard or high risk. In order to 
ensure appropriate transparency and clarity, the Commission should in particular make publicly available the data 
being used for benchmarking, the reasons for the proposed change of classification and the reply of the country 
concerned. For relevant products from low-risk countries or parts thereof operators should be allowed to exercise 
simplified due diligence. For relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof competent authorities 
should be required to apply enhanced scrutiny. The Commission should be empowered to adopt implementing 
acts to establish the list of countries or parts thereof that present a low or high risk.EN  L 150/216 Official Journal of the European Union 9.6.2023  
( 13 ) Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs 
Code (OJ L 269, 10.10.2013, p. 1).","The criteria to assess the deforestation and forest degradation risk at the level of a country or parts thereof should include a range of quantitative, objective, and internationally recognized data, alongside indications of the countries' active engagement in combating deforestation and forest degradation. This assessment should leverage benchmarking information to facilitate due diligence by operators within the Union and enable competent authorities to monitor and enforce compliance more effectively. The benchmarking system should classify countries into three tiers: low, standard, or high risk, based on their deforestation and forest degradation risk. The Commission should make the data used for benchmarking publicly available, including the reasons for any proposed change in a country's classification and the response from the concerned country. This approach aims to enhance the transparency and sustainability of supply chains, incentivize producer countries to improve the sustainability of their agricultural production systems, and reduce their deforestation impact."
How should competent authorities cooperate with high-risk countries and relevant stakeholders to reduce the level of risk?," (69)  The Commission should cooperate with countries which are classified or could be classified as high risk, and with 
relevant stakeholders in those countries, in order to work towards reducing the level of risk.  
(70)  Competent authorities should carry out checks at regular intervals on operators and traders to verify that they 
effectively fulfil the obligations laid down in this Regulation. Moreover, competent authorities should carry out 
checks on the basis of relevant information in their possession, including substantiated concerns submitted by 
third parties. Competent authorities should use a risk-based approach to identify the checks to be carried out. In 
respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as high risk, the respective operators and 
traders and the volumes of their share of relevant commodities and relevant products, a twofold approach that 
provides comprehensive coverage should apply. Competent authorities should thus be required to check on a 
certain percentage of operators and traders, whilst also covering a specific percentage of relevant products. In 
respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as low or standard risk, competent 
authorities should be required to check at least a certain percentage of operators and traders. The level of 
checks should be higher for relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof whereas it could be 
lower for standard or low-risk countries or parts thereof. In its review of this Regulation, the Commission should 
evaluate and identify quantified objectives for the annual checks to be carried out by competent authorities that 
are appropriate to ensure the enforcement of this Regulation and a harmonised approach across the Union.  
(71)  The checks carried out on operators and traders by competent authorities should cover the due diligence systems 
and the compliance of the relevant products with this Regulation. The checks should be based on a risk-based 
plan which contains risk criteria to enable competent authorities to carry out a risk analysis of the due diligence 
statements submitted by operators and traders. The risk criteria should take into account the risk of deforestation 
associated to relevant commodities in the country of production, the history of non-compliance of operators and 
traders with the obligations of this Regulation and any other relevant information available to competent author ­
ities. The risk analysis of due diligence statements should enable the competent authorities to identify those 
operators, traders and relevant products that need to be checked. That risk analysis should be carried out using 
electronic data processing techniques in the information system through which the due diligence statements are 
submitted. Where necessary and technically possible, competent authorities, after consultation and in close 
cooperation with authorities of third countries, should also be able to carry out checks in situ.  
(72)  In cases where the risk analysis of the due diligence statements reveals a high risk of non-compliance of specific 
relevant products, the competent authorities should be able to take immediate interim measures to prevent the 
placing or making available on the market or the export of those products. In cases where such relevant products 
were entering or leaving the market, the competent authorities should request from the customs authorities the 
suspension of the release for free circulation or of export, to enable competent authorities to carry out the 
necessary checks. Such requests should be communicated by means of the interface system between customs 
authorities and competent authorities. The suspension of the placing or making available on the market, of the 
release for free circulation or of export should be limited to three working days, or 72 hours in the case of 
perishable relevant products, except where the competent authorities require additional time to assess the 
compliance of the relevant commodities and relevant products with this Regulation. In such cases, the 
competent authorities should take additional interim measures to extend the suspension period or, in the case 
of relevant products entering or leaving the market, request an extension from the customs authorities.  
(73)  The competent authorities should regularly update their plans of checks on the basis of the results of imple ­
menting those checks. Those operators showing a consistent track record of compliance could be subject to less 
frequent checks.  
(74)  In order to ensure implementation and effective enforcement of this Regulation, Member States should have the 
power to withdraw and recall non-compliant products and take appropriate corrective actions. They should also 
ensure that infringements of this Regulation by operators and traders are subject to effective, proportionate and 
dissuasive penalties.  
(75)  In order to increase the accountability of operators and traders, the Commission should publish on its website the 
list of final judgments against legal persons for infringements of this Regulation and the penalties imposed on 
them. That information could help competent authorities, other operators and traders carry out their risk 
assessments and increase the awareness of consumers and civil society as regards operators and traders who 
infringe this Regulation.EN  9.6.2023 Official Journal of the European Union L 150/217","To reduce the level of risk in cooperation with high-risk countries and relevant stakeholders, competent authorities should: 1. Carry out regular checks on operators and traders to ensure compliance with the obligations of the EUDR, using a risk-based approach to identify necessary checks. 2. Perform checks based on relevant information, including concerns submitted by third parties, and ensure a comprehensive coverage by checking a certain percentage of operators, traders, and relevant products from high-risk areas. 3. Apply a twofold approach for high-risk countries, requiring checks on both a specific percentage of operators and traders and a specific percentage of relevant products, while maintaining a higher level of checks for high-risk countries compared to standard or low-risk countries. 4. Develop a risk-based plan containing criteria for risk analysis of due diligence statements submitted by operators and traders, taking into account factors such as the risk of deforestation in the country of production and the history of non-compliance. 5. Utilize electronic data processing techniques for risk analysis and, where necessary and technically possible, carry out in situ checks in cooperation with third-country authorities. 6. Take immediate interim measures to prevent the market placement or export of products identified as high risk of non-compliance, including requesting the suspension of release for free circulation or export from customs authorities. 7. Regularly update plans of checks based on the results of implementing those checks, potentially subjecting operators with a consistent track record of compliance to less frequent checks. 8. Ensure that non-compliant products can be withdrawn or recalled and that infringements are subject to effective, proportionate, and dissuasive penalties. 9. Increase accountability by publishing a list of final judgments against legal persons for infringements of the EUDR and the penalties imposed on them, to assist in risk assessments and raise consumer and civil society awareness."
What opportunities and possibilities for support are available at Union level for Member States to use in the context of implementing the EUDR?," 
(76)  The implementation of this Regulation will require sufficient resources and capacity. In that context, in addition 
to national resources, Member States should, as much as possible, use the opportunities and possibilities for 
support that are available at Union level and other means, including cohesion funds and capacity-building 
instruments, in particular in the context of the Technical Support Instrument, established by Regulation (EU) 
2021/240 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  14 ). 
(77)  Taking into account the international character of deforestation and forest degradation and related trade, 
competent authorities should cooperate with each other, with customs authorities of the Member States, with 
the Commission and with the administrative authorities of third countries. Competent authorities should also 
cooperate with the competent authorities for the supervision and enforcement of other Union legal acts that set 
out due diligence requirements in the value chain with regard to adverse impacts on human rights or on the 
environment.  
(78)  According to settled case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union, it is for the courts of the Member 
States to ensure judicial protection of a person’s rights under Union law. Furthermore, Article 19(1) of the Treaty 
on European Union (TEU) requires Member States to provide remedies that are sufficient to ensure effective 
judicial protection in the fields covered by Union law. In this respect, Member States should ensure that the 
public, including natural or legal persons submitting substantiated concerns in accordance with this Regulation, 
has access to justice in line with the obligations that Member States have agreed to as parties to the UN Economic 
Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making 
and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters of 25 June 1998 (the ‘Aarhus Convention ’).  
(79)  In order to ensure that this Regulation remain relevant and in line with trade, scientific and technological 
developments, the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to 
the Commission in respect of the list of CN codes of relevant products set out in Annex I to this Regulation. It is 
of particular importance that the Commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work, 
including at expert level, and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down 
in the Interinstitutional Agreement of 13 April 2016 on Better Law-Making (  15 ). In particular, to ensure equal 
participation in the preparation of delegated acts, the European Parliament and the Council receive all documents 
at the same time as Member States’ experts, and their experts systematically have access to meetings of 
Commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts.  
(80)  Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 prohibits the placing of illegally harvested timber and timber products on the 
Union market. It lays down obligations for operators placing timber on the market for the first time to exercise 
due diligence and for traders to keep a traceable record of their suppliers and customers. This Regulation should 
maintain the obligation to ensure the legality of relevant products, including wood and wood products, placed on 
the market and should complement that obligation with a requirement on sustainability. Regulation (EU) 
No 995/2010 and the related Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 607/2012 (  16 ) are therefore 
rendered redundant by this Regulation and should be repealed. Timber and timber products as defined in 
Article 2, point (a), of Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 are the equivalent of wood and wood products that are 
listed in Annex I to this Regulation and that contain or have been made using wood.  
(81)  Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 establishes a Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) licensing 
scheme for imports of timber into the Union. The licensing scheme is implemented through voluntary part ­
nership agreements (VPAs) with timber producing countries, intended to halt illegal logging and to enhance forest 
governance and related trade. This Regulation should build upon the positive results achieved under FLEGT, 
especially in terms of enhanced stakeholders’ participation and improved forest governance. In specific cases, 
VPAs could complement this Regulation with regard to the legality of timber products. To respect ongoing

Cooperation with authorities responsible for supervising and enforcing Union legal acts related to due diligence requirements in the value chain concerning human rights or environmental impacts is also advised. Furthermore, Member States should ensure public access to justice in accordance with the Aarhus Convention. The Regulation also allows for the delegation of powers to the Commission to adapt the list of relevant products in Annex I in response to trade, scientific, and technological developments, ensuring consultations are conducted in line with the principles of better law-making. Moreover, the Regulation builds upon the FLEGT licensing scheme, indicating that specific Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) could complement the EUDR regarding the legality of timber products."
What specific provisions should be included in the Regulation to ensure that wood and wood products covered by a valid FLEGT license comply with the legality requirement?," system in place (FLEGT licensing stage) and work, where relevant and agreed, with current VPA partners towards 
them reaching that stage, this Regulation should include a provision declaring that wood and wood products that 
are covered by a valid FLEGT license are deemed to comply with the legality requirement of Regulation (EC) 
No 2173/2005.  
(82)  While this Regulation addresses deforestation and forest degradation, as envisaged in the communication on 
Stepping up EU Action to Protect and Restore the World’s Forests, protecting forests should not lead to the 
conversion or degradation of other natural ecosystems. Ecosystems, including managed ecosystems, such as 
wetlands, savannahs and peatlands are highly significant to global efforts to combat climate change and the 
biodiversity crisis, as well as other SDGs and their conversion or degradation require particular urgent action and 
need to be prevented. In light of the Union’s footprint on non-forest natural ecosystems, the Commission should 
evaluate and, where appropriate, present a legislative proposal on extending the scope of this Regulation to other 
wooded land at the latest one year after the date of entry into force of this Regulation. Moreover, no later than 
two years after that date of entry into force, the Commission should evaluate and, where appropriate, present a 
legislative proposal on, extending the scope of this Regulation to other natural ecosystems, including other land 
with high carbon stocks and with a high biodiversity value such as grasslands, peatlands and wetlands. 
Ecosystems are also increasingly under pressure from conversion and degradation due to commodity production 
for the Union market. The Commission should also assess the need and feasibility of extending the scope to 
further commodities at the latest two years after the date of entry into force of this Regulation. At the same time, 
the Commission should also undertake a review of the list of CN codes of relevant products set out in Annex I to 
this Regulation.  
(83)  Taking into account the request made by the European Parliament in its resolution ‘An EU legal framework to 
halt and reverse EU-driven global deforestation ’ of 22 October 2020 and that made by the vast majority of the 
almost 1,2 million participants in the Commission’s public consultation, the Commission should focus its 
evaluation and any future legislative proposal on an extension of the scope of this Regulation to non-forest 
ecosystems and their conversion and degradation.  
(84)  Where, for the purposes of this Regulation, it is necessary to process personal data, those data are to be handled 
in accordance with Union law on the protection of personal data. Any processing of personal data under this 
Regulation is subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  17 ) and 
Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council (  18 ), as applicable.  
(85)  Since the objective of this Regulation, namely fighting against deforestation and forest degradation by reducing 
the contribution of consumption in the Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States but can 
rather, by reason of its scale, be better achieved at Union level, the Union may adopt measures, in accordance 
with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the TEU. In accordance with the principle of 
proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to 
achieve that objective.

export from the Union of relevant products, as listed in Annex I, that contain, have been fed with or have been made 
using relevant commodities, namely cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya and wood, with a view to:

This provision would recognize the FLEGT licensing system as a robust mechanism for verifying the legality of wood and wood products, thereby facilitating compliance with the EU's deforestation and forest degradation objectives. Additionally, this approach supports the ongoing efforts and cooperation with countries engaged in Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) to reach the FLEGT licensing stage, ensuring a harmonized and effective implementation of legality requirements across the Union."
